## My Personal Website

This repository hosts the code for my personal website.

[Bhavish Jan | CS Undergrad @ FAST NUCES Islamabad](https://bhavishjan.github.io/)

I’m Bhavish Jan, a first-year CS student at FAST NUCES Islamabad.
This repo is for my personal website, where I’ll eventually share projects, notes, and maybe even the bugs I can’t fix.

Right now I’m still learning the basics: programming, Git/GitHub, Linux, and how not to break my laptop every other day.

If you’re here, feel free to explore. If something doesn’t work, just assume it’s a “feature.
